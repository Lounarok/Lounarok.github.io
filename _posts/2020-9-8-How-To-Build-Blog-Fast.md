When you search everything on google and just found creating a gitpage is not enough...

Acutally you need is a template for jekyll. 
I choose [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as my template which is easier to modify without hassle.

There is a readme on it's template and a more detail post [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
