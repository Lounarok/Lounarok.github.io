###Creating a Git Page is not enough for a simple blog
When you search everything on google and just found creating a gitpage is not enough...

Acutally you need is a template for jekyll. 
I choose [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) as my template which is easier to modify without hassle.

There is a [readme](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on Github and a more detail post [here](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).

###Fast steps to start
1. Fork [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) 
2. Change `_config.yml`, `about.md` and `images\jekyll-logo.png`.
3. Add posts in `repo\_posts\YYYY-MM-DD-TitleHere.md`. Note for MM-DD you need to remove leading zeroes.
4. You may see new post in `_posts` in your main page.
